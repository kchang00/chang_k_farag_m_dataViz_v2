					Have you ever wondered how well Canada has done in the Winter Olympics? The answer is very well! Canada has won many medals since the Olympics first began. Isn't Canada just the greatest?

		<h2>Distribution of Medals by Gender</h2>
			<div class="vis">
			<img class="visImg" src="images/pie_men_vs_women.png" alt="Canada Medals by Gender Pie Chart">
				<p>
					Is the distribution of genders equal? Stats say that men have won more medals than women in the past overall, as well as in individual categories of medals (gold, silver and bronze). That's really too bad, because both genders are awesome sauce (as well as the genders not included in these graphs). People are awesome and should be equal. Hopefully we will see a more even distribution of medals in the future.

			<img class="visImg" src="images/bar_men_vs_women.png" alt="Canada Medals by Gender Bar Chart">
				<p>
					Women have less medals than men in every category. It could be because more men are participating in the olympics. However, that is still less than ideal. More comparisons are necessary to determine if the percentage of medals won by men is still larger than the percentage of medals won by women.

		<h2>Canada Rivalries</h2>
			<div class="vis">
				<img class="visImg" src="images/bar_canada_vs_world.png" alt="Ice Hockey: Canada Medals VS. World">
				<p>
					Canada reigns supreme in its national winter sport, ice hockey. In fact, we have nearly half of all the gold medals in ice hockey. Isn't that something? Go us.

			<div class="vis">
				<img class="visImg" src="images/pie_canada_vs_usa.png" alt="Canada VS. USA Medal Count">
				<p>
					Canada is also always compared to their neighbours, the United States of America. They have slightly more medals than us, but they do have a population of 327.16 million (2018) vs Canada's population of 36.95 million (2018). That's a population that's 8.85 times bigger than Canada, but do they have even 8 times the medals we do? Of course not. We're almost equal. Because Canada is awesome.
