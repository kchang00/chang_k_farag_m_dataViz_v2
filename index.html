		<h2>Overall Performance</h2>
			<p>
				Have you ever wondered how well Canada has done in the Winter Olympics? The answer is very well! Canada has won many medals since the Olympics first began. Isn't Canada just the greatest?

		<h2>Distribution of Medals by Gender</h2>
			<p>
				Is the distribution of genders equal? Stats say that men have won more medals than women in the past overall, as well as in individual categories of medals (gold, silver and bronze). That's really too bad, because both genders (as well as the genders not included in these graphs) are awesome sauce. People are awesome and should be equal. Hopefully we will see a more even distribution of medals in the future.
